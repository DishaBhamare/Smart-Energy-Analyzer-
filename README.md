The Smart Energy Consumption Analyzer is a web-based application that analyzes energy consumption data to help users understand usage patterns, identify peak consumption periods, and gain insights for better energy efficiency.

Users can upload energy consumption data in CSV format, which is processed by the backend to generate meaningful analytics. This project focuses on promoting energy awareness, cost optimization, and data-driven decision making.
